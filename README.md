# Disease Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
<br>
This project focuses on predicting three common diseases: Heart Disease, Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, and Diabetes using machine learning models. The objective is to use various datasets and train models that can predict whether a person is at risk of any of these diseases based on their features and data inputs.

## Overview
<br>
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict if a person has a risk of Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, or Diabetes based on historical health data. The project uses popular machine learning algorithms and evaluates their performance on each of the three diseases.

## Datasets Used:
<br>
Heart Disease Dataset: The dataset contains patient features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, and predicts the risk of heart disease.
Parkinson's Disease Dataset: The dataset contains features related to speech patterns, motor abilities, and other medical data to predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease.
Diabetes Dataset: This dataset contains patient features like age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and more to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Technologies
<br>
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library for building and training models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
